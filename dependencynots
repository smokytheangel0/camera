sled has some issues including data races in lock_api
	unwinding behaviour
	data durability
	panic
	contains_key returns true even if key does not exist

stateright is in the process of switching from actix
	it also has an old version of crossbeam
	from an old version of tokio
	and a potential segfault in time
	all from actix I think


raster is no longer maintained, and the version of
	image it uses is vulnerable to use after free and

	image is maintained however and has newer versions.

	raster compiles with the new versions, someone has
	already made a pull request, crate is unmaintained
	we should replicate that pull, because it built
	in on its own, but is now surfacing the image
	api mismatch i think
	https://github.com/kosinix/raster/pull/27/commits/e56a010aa551c69aad08c15ebf14a6ae8001ecc3
	this dif mostly does the job I believe

nnoiseless uses an older version of clap that uses atty crate
	instead of std::io::is_terminal. atty has a unaligned read
	on windows
	should try updating to a newer version of clap and pulling
	the nnoiseless is maintained
